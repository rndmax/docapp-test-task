# Test task of Docapp Front-End Developer

## Description

My solution to the proposed problem. I did it on pure js (jQuery is involved in bootstrap tabs).
I did not understand the value of the "Timeout" field, so I implemented it at my discretion.
For a change, I solved some tasks in different ways, for example, loading data: asynchronously through calls to the API and through loading the module.

## Requirements

  - The latest stable version of node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/

## launch

  - Clone your repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rndmax/docapp-test-task.git
```
  - Go to the root directory of the project and install the dependencies with the command:
```sh
npm install
```
  - To start the project, run the command:
```sh
npm start
```
